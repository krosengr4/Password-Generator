# My Password Generator Application:
In the Password Generator application, a user can generate a random password between 8 and 128 characters long.
The characters that can be included are upper and lower case letters, numbers, and a 20 different special characters.

When the user opens the application and click on the "Generate Password" button, the user is then prompted with 5 questions.
The questions are how long they want the password to be, if they want lowercase letters, if they want uppercase letters, if they want any numbers, and if they want any special characters. 

After the user answers these questions, a randomly generated password will then appear in the box.
